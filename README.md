EDAV Project 3

Third project for the Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization class in the Masters of Data Science program at Columbia University. The presentation can be found in the SixPack.html file in the folder. This was a team project with five other collaborators. My contribution was the writeup, choropleth map and gif at the end of the final presentation.
